\section{Formatting Instructions}

\LaTeXe{} Authors: please try to use the paragraph styles contained
in this document.

\subsection{Page/Font Settings}

It is strongly recommended that prospective authors download
suitable style file for use with \LaTeX{} and templates for use with
MS Word.

Style files and templates provided here have been created to ensure
that margin requirement is adequately met. If, for some reason, you
are not able to use the provided templates or style files, please
strictly observe the margins and font settings in 
Tables~\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}.

    \hhline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Section and Subsection Headings}

Number section and subsection headings consecutively in Arabic numbers and
type them in bold. Avoid using too many capital letters. If any further
subdivision of a subsection is needed the titles should be 10 point and
flushed left.

\subsection{Main Text}

Use Times New Roman with font size 10 point for text (character
size). There is no separation between paragraphs, and the first line of 
each paragraph is indented by 1em.
You may type on plain white A4 paper. Typing area should not exceed
176mm$\times$255mm. The text should be prepared with a double
column format and single line spacing.

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered in the column and numbered consecutively
(in Arabic numbers). Table headings should be placed above the table.
Place tables as close as possible to where they are mentioned in the
main text (see Table~\ref{tab1} and Table~\ref{tab2}).

\subsection{Figures}

All illustrations should be original drawings or photographic prints of
originals.  Photographs should be glossy prints. Photocopies are often
not good enough and should be avoided.  All illustrations must be numbered
consecutively, using Arabic numbers.  Center figure captions beneath the
figure (see Fig.~\ref{fig1}). If possible, do not assemble figures at the
back of your article, but place them as close as possible to where they are
mentioned in the main text. No part of a figure should go beyond the typing
area. Captions should appear below graphical objects, as in Fig.~\ref{fig1}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{fig1.eps}
  \caption{The figure caption}
  \label{fig1}
\end{figure}

Color and grayscale figures should be prepared with 400 dpi
resolution and  saved with no compression, monochrome figure should
be prepared with 600 dpi resolution and saved with no compression.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulas}

Mathematical formulas should be roughly centered and have to be numbered
as formula~(\ref{eq1}).
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq1}
  \lambda_{1,2} = 0.5 \left[\, c_{11} + c_{12}
            \sqrt{(c_{11} + c_{12})^2 + 4 c_{12} c_{21}} \,\right]
\end{equation}

\subsection{References}

References are listed by order of first appearance and the reference
items are represented as Arabic numbers in square brackets, e.g.
\cite{cheng2005,poor1985,smith,cheng2005a,cheng2005b}.

References are titled as ``References" with 11pt bold font, flush
left and no indent, paragraph spacing before 6pt and after 6pt. The
body text of references is formatted as 9pt Times New Roman, initial
paragraph no indentation, hanging indent 0.7cm, single space and
paragraph spacing after 2pt.

\balance

For journal paper references, the information should be included
such as author name, article title, journal title, volume number,
issue number, page number, year. Similarly, author name, book name,
edition number, publisher and year should be included for book
references. Examples of both journal paper and book references are
shown at the end of this template.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Proceedings or Books\\
Give publisher and its location. Give date as (year, month) or (year).

  \item Journal Article\\
Include the issue number in parentheses immediately after the volume number. Give page numbers.

  \item Article in Proceedings or Books\\
Give publisher and its location. Give date as (year, month) or (year). Include page numbers.
\end{itemize}


\section{Checklist}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Do not end a page with a section or subsection heading.
  \item Do not include page numbers in the text.
  \item Large figures, tables and mathematical equations may span both columns.
  \item To balance the two columns on the last page, place the command
    \verb|\balance| somewhere in the text of what would be the first
    column of the last page without balanced columns.
  \item If you have to plug a large formula, table, etc.,  which needs a cross
  column space, you must add the option\\
  \verb|    usemulticol|\\ to the
  \verb|\documentclass| command, then use the command\\
  \verb|    \singlecolumn{contents}|\\ to input cross column contents.

% 如果希望在正文中插入跨栏内容，则需要在 \verb|\documentclass| 命令中
% 加入 \verb|usemulticol| 选项，然后用命令 \verb|\singlecolumn{内容}|
% 插入跨栏内容，参看后面说明形式的示例。该选项利用 \verb|multicol| 宏包
% 实现单双栏切换，缺点是有脚注的页面的底部对不齐。
\end{itemize}

\section{Paper Submission}

After proofreading your paper, it must be submitted via
http://cms.amss.ac.cn/ electronically including both MS
Word and PDF formats (or \LaTeX{} and PDF formats).

\subsection{Electronic Image Files (Optional)}

You will have the greatest control over the appearance of your figures if you
are able to prepare electronic image files. Please prepare the image files in
PostScript(PS) or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) formats. Use a separate file
for each image. File names should be of the form ``fig1.ps'' or ``fig2.eps''.
Please pack the image files and the paper files (both MS Word and PDF formats
or \LaTeX{} and PDF formats) altogether in zip or rar format and upload
the packed file.
